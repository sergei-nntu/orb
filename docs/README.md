# Installation, configuration, and launch
There are two methods for installing, configuring, and launching the whole infrastructure:

- Locally (orb, orm, orm-ros)
- Docker (docker compose, docker images)

# Locally

First of all, you need to configure and launch the repositories in that order:

1) orm-ros - source code of robots
2) orm - server
3) orb - client

## orm-ros
